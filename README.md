# "Taste of Russia" project-frontend
Rails backend API for MOD4 final project "Taste of Russia" (browse, delete and save Russian recipes)
## Installation
Clone the backend (server) and fire up the server first - rails s to start the server. 
* When running the server: rails s -p<some_number_other_than_3000> because by default both the client app and rails app will run on port 3000 (you have to specify one or another to run on a separate port)
